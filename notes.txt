1> C does not have boolean datatype we have to import <stdbool>

2> assert.h is used to create test case

3> Linkedlist impletion by stack
  
 1> for push and pop it uses o(n)



4> Implementaion of array using stack

  why we increase size of array by --> size*2

   1> push operation in arr --> for(n) ---> It will take  --> N+(2*(N-1));
        3N - 1 --> O(n)



5> Heap is always slower than stack --->
